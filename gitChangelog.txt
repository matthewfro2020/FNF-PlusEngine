- The SScript 7.7.0 library, previously used by Psych Engine 0.7.3, has been added. This should resolve many bugs in older Psych mods. Don't worry, HScript-Iris is still in the engine, so it won't break any mods.
- The character will now maintain their dancing position if you hold down a key.
- Hxvlc updated to version 2.2.5
- New feature: animated icons just like codename (apparently)
- New gameplay option: System Score Multiplier
